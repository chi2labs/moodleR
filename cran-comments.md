## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Added global variable declaration for nse fix (tidyverse)

## Test environments
* local R installation, R 4.2.3
* rhub_check

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes


* Possible spelling errors have been double checked and are OK.
